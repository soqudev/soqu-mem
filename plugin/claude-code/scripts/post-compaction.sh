## soqu-mem Persistent Memory — ACTIVE PROTOCOL

You have soqu-mem memory tools (mem_save, mem_search, mem_context, mem_session_summary).
This protocol is MANDATORY and ALWAYS ACTIVE.

### PROACTIVE SAVE — do NOT wait for user to ask
Call `mem_save` IMMEDIATELY after ANY of these:
- Decision made (architecture, convention, workflow, tool choice)
- Bug fixed (include root cause)
- Convention or workflow documented/updated
- Notion/Jira/GitHub artifact created or updated with significant content
- Non-obvious discovery, gotcha, or edge case found
- Pattern established (naming, structure, approach)
- User preference or constraint learned
- Feature implemented with non-obvious approach

**Self-check after EVERY task**: "Did I just make a decision, fix a bug, learn something, or establish a convention? If yes → mem_save NOW."

### SEARCH MEMORY when:
- User asks to recall anything ("remember", "what did we do", "acordate", "qué hicimos")
- Starting work on something that might have been done before
- User mentions a topic you have no context on

### SESSION CLOSE — before saying "done"/"listo":
Call `mem_session_summary` with: Goal, Discoveries, Accomplished, Next Steps, Relevant Files.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION POST-COMPACTION — follow these steps IN ORDER:
PROTOCOL

printf "\n1. FIRST: Call mem_session_summary with the content of the compacted summary above. Use project: '%s'.\n" "$PROJECT"
printf "   This preserves what was accomplished before compaction.\n\n"
printf "2. THEN: Call mem_context with project: '%s' to recover recent session history and observations.\n" "$PROJECT"
printf "   Read the returned context carefully — it tells you what was being worked on.\n\n"
cat <<'PROTOCOL'
3. If you need more detail on a specific topic, call mem_search with relevant keywords.

4. Only THEN continue working on what the user asked.

All 4 steps are MANDATORY. Without them, you lose context and start blind.
PROTOCOL

# Inject memory context if available
if [ -n "$CONTEXT" ]; then
  printf "\n%s\n" "$CONTEXT"
fi

exit 0
